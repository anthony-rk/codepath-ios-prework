## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app.

App 1: Robinhood
- Intuitive UI
- Nice charts

App 2: Carta
- Intuitive UI
- Nice charts

App 3: Discord
- Easy to use
- Minimal ads


Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

An app I would like to build would be something similar to Yelp but focused solely on cafes and boba shops. The app would have a similar search and review functionality, but it would also allow for a more granular review and ranking of items at each shop. This would be useful for others to see your reviews, and also important for the user to see how they reviewed items previously (e.e was that Thai tea too sweet before?).

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Not really any, just a bit of a learning curve to use Xcode and Swift
